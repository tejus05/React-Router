# React Router 

This is a sample code snippet demonstrating the use of React Router for routing in a React application built with Vite.

## Description

This code is an example of how to set up routing in a React application created with Vite, using the React Router library. It defines various routes for different components, allowing users to navigate between different pages in the application.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejus05/React-Router/
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd [project directory]
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Dependencies

- Vite
- React
- ReactDOM
- React Router DOM

## Code Explanation

- The code is written in a Vite project and includes imports for the necessary modules and components, including React, ReactDOM, and components like `App`, `Layout`, `Home`, `About`, `Contact`, `User`, and `Github`.

- It sets up a router using the `createBrowserRouter` function and defines various routes using the `Route` component from React Router. Each route is associated with a specific component.

- The code also includes a loader function for the `/github` route, which suggests asynchronous data loading for that specific route.

- Finally, it renders the React application within a root element, wrapping it in a `RouterProvider` to enable routing.
